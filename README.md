# Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts customer churn using a **Random Forest Classifier** in Python. It demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. By identifying potential churners, businesses can take proactive steps to retain customers.

## Overview
Customer churn refers to when customers stop using a companyâ€™s services. Predicting churn helps businesses take timely actions to retain customers and improve their services. This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict churn with a focus on the following:
- Data cleaning and transformation.
- Feature engineering for better model performance.
- Visualization of key insights.

---

## Motivation
In competitive industries, retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project was motivated by the need to:
- Understand why customers churn.
- Develop predictive models to flag at-risk customers.
- Enable businesses to create targeted retention strategies.

---

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer demographics, service usage, and churn status.  
**Source:** [Kaggle Dataset ]

Key columns include:
- `customerID`: Unique identifier.
- `tenure`: Duration of customer service.
- `MonthlyCharges`: Monthly fee.
- `Churn`: Target variable indicating churn (Yes/No).

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Handle missing values, drop duplicates, and encode categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze key trends and correlations using visualizations.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Select relevant predictors based on correlation and importance.
4. **Model Training:** Use the **Random Forest Classifier** for prediction.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model using metrics like:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score
6. **Visualization:** Create visual aids such as:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Feature Importance Plot
